  abstract = { Designing and tuning a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller
	appears to be conceptually intuitive, but can be hard in practice,
	if multiple (and often conflicting) objectives such as short transient
	and high stability are to be achieved. Usually, initial designs obtained
	by all means need to be adjusted repeatedly through computer simulations
	until the closed-loop system performs or compromises as desired.
	This stimulates the development of "intelligent" tools that can assist
	engineers to achieve the best overall PID control for the entire
	operating envelope. This development has further led to the incorporation
	of some advanced tuning algorithms into PID hardware modules. Corresponding
	to these developments, this paper presents a modern overview of functionalities
	and tuning methods in patents, software packages and commercial hardware
	modules. It is seen that many PID variants have been developed in
	order to improve transient performance, but standardising and modularising
	PID control are desired, although challenging. The inclusion of system
	identification and "intelligent" techniques in software based PID
	systems helps automate the entire design and tuning process to a
	useful degree. This should also assist future development of "plug-and-play"
	PID controllers that are widely applicable and can be set up easily
	and operate optimally for enhanced productivity, improved quality
	and reduced maintenance requirements.},

  abstract = {Most controllers optimization and design problems are multiobjective
	in nature, since they normally have several (possibly conflicting)
	objectives that must be satisfied at the same time. Instead of aiming
	at finding a single solution, the multiobjective optimization methods
	try to produce a set of good trade-off solutions from which the decision
	maker may select one. Several methods have been devised for solving
	multiobjective optimization problems in control systems field. Traditionally,
	classical optimization algorithms based on nonlinear programming
	or optimal control theories are applied to obtain the solution of
	such problems. The presence of multiple objectives in a problem usually
	gives rise to a set of optimal solutions, largely known as Pareto-optimal
	solutions. Recently, Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs)
	have been applied to control systems problems. Compared with mathematical
	programming, MOEAs are very suitable to solve multiobjective optimization
	problems, because they deal simultaneously with a set of solutions
	and find a number of Pareto optimal solutions in a single run of
	algorithm. Starting from a set of initial solutions, MOEAs use iteratively
	improving optimization techniques to find the optimal solutions.
	In every iterative progress, MOEAs favor population-based Pareto
	dominance as a measure of fitness. In the MOEAs context, the Non-dominated
	Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) has been successfully applied
	to solving many multiobjective problems. This paper presents the
	design and the tuning of two PID (ProportionalÂIntegralÂDerivative)
	controllers through the NSGA-II approach. Simulation numerical results
	of multivariable PID control and convergence of the NSGA-II is presented
	and discussed with application in a robotic manipulator of two-degree-of-freedom.
	The proposed optimization method based on NSGA-II offers an effective
	way to implement simple but robust solutions providing a good reference
	tracking performance in closed loop.},

	designs an alternative pPI strategy. The original software used the

	All of the strategies considered are based on a first-order-plus-deadtime

	weighted sum method has far reaching implications. However, despite
	the many published applications for this method and the literature
	addressing its pitfalls with respect to depicting the Pareto optimal
	set, there is little comprehensive discussion concerning the conceptual
	significance of the weights and techniques for maximizing the effectiveness
	of the method with respect to a priori articulation of preferences.
	Thus, in this paper, we investigate the fundamental significance
	of the weights in terms of preferences, the Pareto optimal set, and
	objective-function values. We determine the factors that dictate
	which solution point results from a particular set of weights. Fundamental
	deficiencies are identified in terms of a priori articulation of
	preferences, and guidelines are provided to help avoid blind use
	of the method.},

  abstract = {Engineering design generally involves two, possibly integrated, phases:
	(i) generating design options, and (ii) choosing the most satisfactory
	option on the basis of some determined criteria. The depth, or lack,
	of integration between these two phases defines different design
	approaches, and differing philosophical views from the part of researchers
	in the field of computational design. Optimization-Based Design (OBD)
	covers the spectrum of this depth of integration. While most OBD
	approaches strongly integrate these two phases, some employ computational
	optimization only in the first or second phase. Regardless of where
	a method or researcher lies in this philosophical spectrum, some
	requisite characteristics are fundamental to the effectiveness of
	OBD methods. In particular, (i) the Aggregate Objective Function
	(AOF) used in the optimization must have the ability to generate
	all Pareto solutions, (ii) the generation of any existing Pareto
	solutions must be possible with reasonable ease, and (iii) even changes
	in the AOF parameters should yield a well distributed set of Pareto
	solutions. This paper examines the effectiveness of physical programming
	(PP) with respect to the latter, yielding favorable conclusions.
	Previous papers have led to similarly positive conclusions with respect
	to the former two. This paper also presents a comparative study featuring
	PP and other popular methods, where PP is shown to perform favorably.
	A PP-based method for generating the Pareto frontier is presented.},

	of this algorithm is that Pareto-optimality of solutions is not guaranteed.
	The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, it presents
	alternate formulation of this algorithms, such that (weak) Pareto-optimality
	of solutions is guaranteed. This improvement makes these algorithm
	theoretically equivalent to other classical algorithms (like weighted-sum
	or ÃÂµ -constraint methods), without losing its ability to generate
	a set of evenly spaced Efficient solutions. Second, an algorithm
	is presented so as to know beforehand about certain sub-problems
	whose solutions are not Pareto-optimal and thus not wasting computational
	effort to solve them. The relationship of the new algorithm with
	weighted-sum and goal programming method is also presented.},

	and using measured data, the controller from the set is chosen online
	which provides the best performance. This scheme is extended here
	by an adaptation of the set of controllers after a change of the
	operating point of the plant. The original concept of unfalsified
	control relies on the computation of the performance of controllers

	from inserting a controller. Therefore a different cost function
	and a new method for online evaluation of controllers that are not
	in the loop without an explicit plant model are proposed. With this
	new cost function, the set of controllers can be adapted as well
	which is performed using an evolutionary algorithm. The method is

  abstract  = {Proportional integral derivative (PID) controller tuning is an area of interest for researchers. This paper presents a novel method for PID controller tuning using a modified biogeography-based optimization(MBBO) algorithm. Biogeography-based optimization (BBO) is a novel evolutionary algorithm that is based on the mathematical models of biogeography. Biogeography is the study of the geographical distribution of biological organisms. In the BBO model, problem solutions are represented as islands, and the sharing of features between solutions is represented as immigration and emigration between the islands. In this paper, a modified version of the BBO is proposed to improve its convergence. The MBBO algorithm is compared with the BBO using benchmarks functions. The proposed algorithm is applied to the problem of PID controller tuning and is compared with conventional biogeography-based optimization (BBO), and Particle swarm optimization (PSO).},
