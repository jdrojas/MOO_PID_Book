abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present a robust tuning method for two-degree-of-freedom (2DoF) proportional integral derivative controllers with filter (PID2F) for inverse response controlled processes modeled by a second-order plus a right-half plane zero (SOPRHPZ) transfer function. This is based on the use of a model-reference optimization procedure with servo and regulatory closed-loop transfer functions targets. The robustness of the control system is also taken into account. Model right-half plane zero relative positions in the range from 0.10 to 3.0 are analyzed, and it is found that the zero position constrains the achievable control system robustness level. The designer is allowed to deal with the performance/robustness trade-off of the closed-loop control system by specifying the desired robustness by means of selecting between two levels for the control system maximum sensitivity (MSt∈{\{}2.0,1.6{\}}). In addition, a smooth servo/regulatory performance combination is obtained. A comparative analysis shows that, for inverse response processes, PID controllers allow to improve control system performance while achieving the same robustness of PI controllers. Small controlled variable undershoots and smooth controller output signal are distinctive characteristics of the proposed model reference robust tuning method.},

@article{Ang2005,
abstract = {Designing and tuning a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller appears to be conceptually intuitive, but can be hard in practice, if multiple (and often conflicting) objectives such as short transient and high stability are to be achieved. Usually, initial designs obtained by all means need to be adjusted repeatedly through computer simulations until the closed-loop system performs or compromises as desired. This stimulates the development of "intelligent" tools that can assist engineers to achieve the best overall PID control for the entire operating envelope. This development has further led to the incorporation of some advanced tuning algorithms into PID hardware modules. Corresponding to these developments, this paper presents a modern overview of functionalities and tuning methods in patents, software packages and commercial hardware modules. It is seen that many PID variants have been developed in order to improve transient performance, but standardising and modularising PID control are desired, although challenging. The inclusion of system identification and "intelligent" techniques in software based PID systems helps automate the entire design and tuning process to a useful degree. This should also assist future development of "plug-and-play" PID controllers that are widely applicable and can be set up easily and operate optimally for enhanced productivity, improved quality and reduced maintenance requirements.},

abstract = {Most controllers optimization and design problems are multiobjective in nature, since they normally have several (possibly conflicting) objectives that must be satisfied at the same time. Instead of aiming at finding a single solution, the multiobjective optimization methods try to produce a set of good trade-off solutions from which the decision maker may select one. Several methods have been devised for solving multiobjective optimization problems in control systems field. Traditionally, classical optimization algorithms based on nonlinear programming or optimal control theories are applied to obtain the solution of such problems. The presence of multiple objectives in a problem usually gives rise to a set of optimal solutions, largely known as Pareto-optimal solutions. Recently, Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have been applied to control systems problems. Compared with mathematical programming, MOEAs are very suitable to solve multiobjective optimization problems, because they deal simultaneously with a set of solutions and find a number of Pareto optimal solutions in a single run of algorithm. Starting from a set of initial solutions, MOEAs use iteratively improving optimization techniques to find the optimal solutions. In every iterative progress, MOEAs favor population-based Pareto dominance as a measure of fitness. In the MOEAs context, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) has been successfully applied to solving many multiobjective problems. This paper presents the design and the tuning of two PID (Proportional{\^{A}}Integral{\^{A}}Derivative) controllers through the NSGA-II approach. Simulation numerical results of multivariable PID control and convergence of the NSGA-II is presented and discussed with application in a robotic manipulator of two-degree-of-freedom. The proposed optimization method based on NSGA-II offers an effective way to implement simple but robust solutions providing a good reference tracking performance in closed loop.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study a multicriteria shape design of a highly nonlinear mechanical 2D structure, namely the shape optimization of the aerosol can bottom. In fact, it is made depending on two criteria, the dome growth DG and the dome reversal pressure DRP, that define the resistance of the bottom against the internal pressure. This two criteria are known to be conflicting; therefore, a multicriteria optimization problem is formulated to represent the trade-offs among the design parameters. Due to the expensive time-consuming cost to solve this kind of optimization problems (e.g., capturing the Pareto front), the use of a surrogate model (e.g., metamodel) cheap to evaluate is mandatory. For this reason, we have developed an algorithm which is a coupling between the normalized normal constraint method (NNCM) and the radial basis function metamodel (RBF). The NNCM-RBF coupling was tested for several academic test cases and for our industrial problem and the obtained results clearly show the efficiency of our coupling to solve all the problems treated with a remarkable gain in the computational time.},

At the same time, it is usually desirable to meet all specified goals using the controllers with simple structures such as proportional-integral (PI) and proportional-integral-derivative (PID) which are useful in industry applications. Since, practically these controllers are commonly tuned based on classical or trial-and-error approaches, they are incapable of obtaining good dynamical performance to capture all design objectives and specification. With regard to above problem, this paper addresses a new method to design of multi-objective PI/PID controller. For this purpose, first the multi-objective control design is reduced to an H2/H infin; static output feedback control synthesis, and then the control parameters are easily carried out using an iterative linear matrix inequalities (ILMI) algorithm. As a numerical example, the proposed method is applied to a multi-area power system to design a set of PI-based robust load frequency controllers.},

abstract = {New challenges in engineering design lead to multiobjective (multicriteria) problems. In this context, the Pareto front supplies a set of solutions where the designer (decision-maker) has to look for the best choice according to his preferences. Visualization techniques often play a key role in helping decision-makers, but they have important restrictions for more than two-dimensional Pareto fronts. In this work, a new graphical representation, called Level Diagrams, for n-dimensional Pareto front analysis is proposed. Level Diagrams consists of representing each objective and design parameter on separate diagrams. This new technique is based on two key points: classification of Pareto front points according to their proximity to ideal points measured with a specific norm of normalized objectives (several norms can be used); and synchronization of objective and parameter diagrams. Some of the new possibilities for analyzing Pareto fronts are shown. Additionally, in order to introduce designer preferences, Level Diagrams can be coloured, so establishing a visual representation of preferences that can help the decision-maker. Finally, an example of a robust control design is presented – a benchmark proposed at the American Control Conference. This design is set as a six-dimensional multiobjective problem.},

abstract = {Robust parameter design (RPD) has recently been applied in modern industries in a large deal of processes. This technique is occasionally employed as a multiobjective optimization approach using weighted sums as a trade-off strategy; in such cases, however, a considerable number of gaps have arisen. In this paper, the use of normal boundary intersection (NBI) method coupled with mean-squared error (MSE) functions is proposed. This approach is capable of generating equispaced Pareto frontiers for a bi-objective robust design model, independent of the relative scales of the objective functions. To verify the adequacy of this proposal, a central composite design (CCD) is developed with combined arrays for the AISI 1045 steel end milling process. In this case study, a CCD with three noise factors and four control factors are used to create the mean and variance equations for MSE of two quality characteristics. The numerical results indicate the NBI-MSE approach is capable of generating a convex and equispaced Pareto frontier to MSE functions of surface roughness, thus nullifying the drawbacks of weighted sums. Moreover, the results show that the achieved optimum lessens the sensitivity of the end milling process to the variability transmitted by the noise factors.},

This can result in a potentially large number of candidate solutions to be considered. Visualizing a Pareto Frontier, the optimal set of solutions to a multi-objective problem, is considered a difficult task when the problem at hand spans more than three objective functions. We introduce a novel visual-interactive approach to facilitate coping with multi-objective problems. We propose a characterization of the Pareto Frontier data and the tasks decision makers face as they reach their decisions. Following a comprehensive analysis of the design alternatives, we show how a semantically-enhanced Self-Organizing Map, can be utilized to meet the identified tasks. We argue that our newly proposed design provides both consistent orientation of the 2D mapping as well as an appropriate visual representation of individual solutions. We then demonstrate its applicability with two real-world multi-objective case studies. We conclude with a preliminary empirical evaluation and a qualitative usefulness assessment. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

The other methods are applied to make comparisons between a classic approach based on the “Ziegler-Nichols” method and a metaheuristic approach based on the genetic algorithms.

abstract = {It is well known that many complex processes are often satisfactorily
controlled by means of simple two-term (PI) and three-term (PID)
controllers. However, for those processes which use PI and PID loops,
the task of ‘tuning' can be very time-consuming and expensive operation.
Consequently, any help offered to the process operator to ease this
tedious task and at the same time produce consistent behaviour is
very desirable. This paper presents a CAD software package that automatically
determines the necessary PI parameters for two-term operation, identifies
those situations where PI is not appropriate, and in these cases
designs an alternative pPI strategy. The original software used the
Ziegler-Nichols empirical settings, but this paper considers a range
of options which (in theory) should realise a less oscillatory response.
All of the strategies considered are based on a first-order-plus-deadtime
(FOPDT) plant model. The paper also introduces a new set of tuning
relationships which, despite their simplicity, appear to realise
a consistent sensibly damped step response, much superior to the
Ziegler-Nichols values. The paper concludes by considering two ‘real
applications', namely, flow and pH control, which illustrate the
quality of the performance achievable using the CAD software},

A regional Hazardous Waste Management scheme should incorporate a comprehensive framework for hazardous waste transportation. This framework would incorporate the various stakeholders involved in decision making. Hence, a multi-objective approach is required to safeguard the interest of all the concerned stakeholders. The objective of this study is to design a methodology for routing of hazardous wastes between the generating units and the disposal facilities through a capacity constrained network. The proposed methodology uses posteriori method with multi-objective approach to find non-dominated solutions for the system consisting of multiple origins and destinations. A case study of transportation of hazardous wastes in Kolkata Metropolitan Area has also been provided to elucidate the methodology. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The bumpless switch between two of the three controllers is a key question and has been solved through using fuzzy switch rules.

abstract = { Optimization is one of the most important and challenging parts of
any engineering design. In real-world design, multiobjective optimization
with constraints has to be considered. The optimal solution in this
case is not unique because the objectives can contradict each other.
Therefore, a set of optimal solutions, which forms the Pareto frontier,
should be considered. There are many algorithms to generate a Pareto
set. However, only a few of them are potentially capable of providing
an evenly distributed set of solutions. This property is especially
important in real-life design because a decision maker is usually
able to analyse only a very limited number of solutions. The main
objective of this article is to develop and give detailed description
of an algorithm that is able to generate an evenly distributed Pareto
set in a general formulation. The approach is based on shrinking
a search domain to generate a Pareto optimal solution in a selected
area on the Pareto frontier. The effectiveness of the algorithm is
demonstrated by a number of challenging test cases. For the first
time, some of these test cases are successfully solved via a classical
approach. },

The parameter uncertainty is given in the form of interval polynomials, where a nominal model is not necessary for the design.

In this paper, we overview some currently prevalent visualisation techniques according to the way how data is represented. To have a better understanding of the pros and cons of different visualisation techniques, we empirically compare six representative visualisation techniques for the exploratory analysis of different Pareto front approximation sets obtained by four state-of-the-art evolutionary multi-objective optimisation algorithms on the classic DTLZ benchmark test problems. From the empirical results, we find that visual comparisons also follow the No-Free-Lunch theorem where no single visualisation technique is able to provide a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics of a Pareto front approximation set. In other words, a specific type of visualisation technique is only good at exploring a particular aspect of the data.},

Several problems are encountered in engineering processes that have adverse effects on the reliability of complex engineering systems. Hence, the aim of this work is to optimize the hardened steel turning process by applying mathematical methods to reduce dimensionality and eliminate the correlation between the multiple responses. The resultant latent response surfaces and their respective targets constitute the normalized multivariate mean square error (MMSE) function that is minimized by the normal boundary intersection (NBI) method. Furthermore, a fuzzy algorithm is applied to identify the best solution from several feasible solutions of the Pareto frontier that is compared with the performances of normalized normal constraint, arc homotopy length, global criterion method, and desirability method. The results show that NBI-MMSE has a higher performance than the other methods. In addition, NBI-MMSE is tested with benchmark functions to evaluate its effectiveness and robustness. Therefore, NBI-MMSE identifies the dynamics of the turning process of AISI H13 steel by revealing the optimal solutions for the input process parameters.},

abstract = {The paper concerns design governed by multiple objective criteria, which are conflicting in the sense of competing for common resources to achieve variously different performance objectives (financial, functional, environmental, esthetical, etc.). A multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) strategy is proposed that employs a tradeoff-analysis technique to identify compromise designs for which the competing criteria are mutually satisfied in a Pareto-optimal sense. The MCDM strategy is initially developed for the case of design governed by n=2 objective criteria. It is then extended to design governed by n{\textgreater}2 objective criteria, by introducing the concept of primary and aggregate criteria. It is proved that, from among the theoretically infinite number of feasible designs forming the Pareto front for a design problem governed by n independent objective criteria, there exists a unique Pareto-compromise design that represents a mutually agreeable tradeoff between all n criteria. This remarkable result is illustrated for a flexural plate design governed by n=2 criteria, a bridge maintenance-intervention protocol design governed by n=3 criteria, and a media centre envelop design governed by n=11 criteria.},

abstract = {We introduce a new interactive multiobjective optimization method operating in the objective space called Nonconvex Pareto Navigator. It extends the Pareto Navigator method for nonconvex problems. An approximation of the Pareto optimal front in the objective space is first generated with the PAINT method using a relatively small set of Pareto optimal outcomes that is assumed to be given or computed prior to the interaction with the decision maker. The decision maker can then navigate on the approximation and direct the search for interesting regions in the objective space. In this way, the decision maker can conveniently learn about the interdependencies between the conflicting objectives and possibly adjust one's preferences. To facilitate the navigation, we introduce special cones that enable extrapolation beyond the given Pareto optimal outcomes. Besides handling nonconvexity, the new method contains new options for directing the navigation that have been inspired by the classification-based interactive NIMBUS method. The Nonconvex Pareto Navigatormethod is especially well-suited for computationally expensive problems, because the navigation on the approximation is computationally inexpensive. We demonstrate the method with an example. Besides proposing the new method, we characterize interactive navigation based methods in general and discuss desirable properties of navigation methods overall and in particular with respect to Nonconvex Pareto Navigator.},

First, visualization throughout the evolutionary process can be exploited in developing effective many-objective evolutionary algorithms. Furthermore, visualization is a crucial component of multi-criteria decision making. By directly observing the performance of each solution, the trade-off between objectives, and distribution of the approximate front, the decision maker can easily decide which solution should be chosen from. In this paper, we make a detailed summary for existing visualization approaches and group them into five different categories. Then, three evaluation criteria for visualization approaches are designed, according to which, five state-of-the-arts are compared under the created data sets. Experimental results show that all approaches can satisfy each criterion to some degree but no one can fully achieve all of these criteria. There is a need to develop the new approach emphasis on fully satisfy all criteria simultaneously.

abstract = {In many-objective optimization, visualization of true Pareto front or obtained non-dominated solutions is difficult. A proper visualization tool must be able to show the location, range, shape, and distribution of obtained non-dominated solutions. However, existing commonly used visualization tools in many-objective optimization (e.g., parallel coordinates) fail to show the shape of the Pareto front. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful visualization method, called 3-dimensional radial coordinate visualization (3D-RadVis). This method is capable of mapping M-dimensional objective space to a 3-dimensional radial coordinate plot while preserving the relative location of solutions, shape of the Pareto front, distribution of solutions, and convergence trend of an optimization process. Furthermore, 3D-RadVis can be used by decision-makers to visually navigate large many-objective solution sets, observe the evolution process, visualize the relative location of a solution, evaluate trade-off among objectives, and select preferred solutions. The visual effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on widely used many-objective benchmark problems containing variety of Pareto fronts (linear, concave, convex, mixed, and disconnected). In addition, we demonstrated the capability of 3D-RadVis for visual progress tracking of the NSGA-III algorithm through generations. It is worthwhile to mention that a suitable visualization is a crucial prerequisite for an effective interactive optimization.},

abstract = {This research presents a novel, state-of-the-art methodology for solving a multi-criteria supplier selection problem considering risk and sustainability. It combines multi-objective optimization with the analytic network process to take into account sustainability requirements of a supplier portfolio configuration. To integrate ‘risk' into the supplier selection problem, we develop a multi-objective optimization model based on the investment portfolio theory introduced by Markowitz. The proposed model is a non-standard portfolio selection problem with four objectives: (1) minimizing the purchasing costs, (2) selecting the supplier portfolio with the highest logistics service, (3) minimizing the supply risk, and (4) ordering as much as possible from those suppliers with outstanding sustainability performance. The optimization model, which has three linear and one quadratic objective function, is solved by an algorithm that analytically computes a set of efficient solutions and provides graphical decision support through a visualization of the complete and exactly-computed Pareto front (a posteriori approach). The possibility of computing all Pareto-optimal supplier portfolios is beneficial for decision makers as they can compare all optimal solutions at once, identify the trade-offs between the criteria, and study how the different objectives of supplier portfolio configuration may be balanced to finally choose the composition that satisfies the purchasing company's strategy best. The approach has been applied to a real-world supplier portfolio configuration case to demonstrate its applicability and to analyze how the consideration of sustainability requirements may affect the traditional supplier selection and purchasing goals in a real-life setting.},

abstract = {Genetic Algorithm (GA) is one of the effective methods in the application to optimization problems. Recently, Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA), which is the application of Genetic Algorithm to Multi-objective Optimization Problems, is focused on in the engineering design field. In this field, the analysis of design variables in the acquired Pareto solutions, which gives the designers useful knowledge in the applied problem, is important as well as the acquisition of advanced solutions. This paper proposes a visualization method using an idea of Isomap, that visualizes manifold embedded in the high dimensional space, which was originally proposed in the field of multiple classification analysis. The proposed method visualizes the geometric distance of solutions in the design variable space considering their distance in the objective space. This method enables a user to analyze the design variables of the acquired solutions considering their relationship in the objective space.

controlled, starting from a simplified representation of its unit

rules are suggested which benefit from the available knowledge on

The control variables in this problem are the initial concentrations of biomass and glycerol and the terminal time of the process. Then, by introducing auxiliary time-delay systems and performing a time-scaling transformation, we transform the robust bi-objective optimal control problem into an equivalent bi-objective optimal control problem in standard form. Furthermore, we convert the equivalent optimal control problem into a sequence of solvable single-objective optimal control problems by using the normalized normal constraint method together with the constraint transcription technique. To solve each of the resulting optimal control problems, we develop a novel gradient-based solution method.

obtained in highly competitive computation times. The proposed method

Although combining the different objectives into a convex weighted sum and varying the weights is the most common approach to generate the Pareto front (when deterministic optimisation routines are exploited), it suffers from several intrinsic drawbacks. A uniform variation of the weights does not necessarily lead to an even spread on the Pareto front, and points in non-convex parts of the Pareto front cannot be obtained [Das, I., Dennis, J.E., 1997.

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Many practical optimal control problems (e.g., (Nonlinear) Model Predictive Control ((N)MPC)) involve multiple and conflicting objectives. Most often, this multi-objective nature is tackled by combining all individual objectives into a global weighted sum. However, selecting appropriate weights is a non-trivial task, especially when no price information is available and/or the different objectives are incommensurable. This paper introduces a strategy that exploits recent scalarisation based multi-objective optimisation methods to generate the set of Pareto optimal solutions from which the decision maker can pick a solution according to his/her preferences. This selected solution can explicitly be linked to a set of weights in a weighted sum approach via analytical relations. These weights can then, e.g., be used for the repeated optimisations in online (N)MPC applications. The proposed selection procedure based on the explicit relations is illustrated for the offline optimal control of a nonlinear jacketed tubular reactor with three conflicting objectives: conversion, net heat transfer and reactor length.},

abstract = {Engineering design generally involves two, possibly integrated, phases:
(i) generating design options, and (ii) choosing the most satisfactory
option on the basis of some determined criteria. The depth, or lack,
of integration between these two phases defines different design
approaches, and differing philosophical views from the part of researchers
in the field of computational design. Optimization-Based Design (OBD)
covers the spectrum of this depth of integration. While most OBD
approaches strongly integrate these two phases, some employ computational
optimization only in the first or second phase. Regardless of where
a method or researcher lies in this philosophical spectrum, some
requisite characteristics are fundamental to the effectiveness of
OBD methods. In particular, (i) the Aggregate Objective Function
(AOF) used in the optimization must have the ability to generate
all Pareto solutions, (ii) the generation of any existing Pareto
solutions must be possible with reasonable ease, and (iii) even changes
in the AOF parameters should yield a well distributed set of Pareto
solutions. This paper examines the effectiveness of physical programming
(PP) with respect to the latter, yielding favorable conclusions.
Previous papers have led to similarly positive conclusions with respect
to the former two. This paper also presents a comparative study featuring
PP and other popular methods, where PP is shown to perform favorably.
A PP-based method for generating the Pareto frontier is presented.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of capturing Pareto optimal points
on non-convex Pareto frontiers, which are encountered in nonlinear
multiobjective optimization problems in computational engineering
design optimization. The emphasis is on the choice of the aggregate
objective function (AOF) of the objectives that is employed to capture
Pareto optimal points. A fundamental property of the aggregate objective
function, the admissibility property, is developed and its equivalence
to the coordinatewise increasing property is established. Necessary
and sufficient conditions for such an admissible aggregate objective
function to capture Pareto optimal points are derived. Numerical
examples illustrate these conditions in the biobjective case. This
paper demonstrates in general terms the limitation of the popular
weighted-sum AOF approach, which captures only convex Pareto frontiers,
and helps us understand why some commonly used AOFs cannot capture
desirable Pareto optimal points, and how to avoid this situation
in practice. Since nearly all applications of optimization in engineering
design involve the formation of AOFs, this paper is of direct theoretical
and practical usefulness.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature. Amoxicillin is a useful antibiotic to combat bacterial infections. However, this drug can cause serious problems when discarded in waterways due to its great bioaccumulation potential. This compound can be treated via advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), which are capable of converting amoxicillin into carbon dioxide and water. In this context, the use of ozone as an oxidizer has excelled in amoxicillin degradation. This paper aims at treating a synthetic solution of amoxicillin (0.1 g L −1 ) in a reactor with ozone bubbling. A Design of Experiment (DoE) with a response surface known as Central Composite Design (CCD) was used to optimize the treatment process. In addition, a Normal Boundary Intersection (NBI) method was used in the construction of a Pareto boundary chart. Results after 1-h treatment showed a reduction of 53{\%} of the initial organic matter from a designed model using factors, such as pH, ozone generator power, and O 3 flow. A model was built from the CCD with score of 0.9929. Thus, the model was able to represent the real scenario with confidence.},

abstract = {Automated calibration methods are a common approach to agent-based model calibration as they can estimate those parameters which cannot be set because of the lack of information. The modeler requires to validate the model by checking the parameter values before the model can be used and this task is very challenging when the model considers two or more conflicting outputs. We propose a multicriteria integral framework to assist the modeler in the calibration and validation of agent-based models that combines evolutionary multiobjective optimization with network-based visualization, which we believe is the first integral approach to model calibration. On the one hand, evolutionary multiobjective optimization provides several sets of calibration solutions (i.e., parameter values) with different trade-offs for the considered objectives in a single run. On the other hand, network-based visualization is used to better understand the decision space and the set of solutions from the obtained Pareto set approximation. To illustrate our proposal, we face the calibration of three agent-based model examples for marketing which consider two conflicting criteria: the awareness of the brand and its word-of-mouth volume. The final analysis of the calibrated solutions shows how our proposed framework eases the analysis of Pareto sets with high cardinality and helps with the identification of flexible solutions (i.e., those having close values in the design space).},

However, visualizing more than 3-dimensional data sets in a fathomable way has always been a serious challenge for researchers in this field. There are some visualizing methods already available such as parallel coordinates, scatter plot matrix, RadViz, bubble charts, heatmaps, Sammon mapping and self organizing maps. In this paper, an axis-based method (called Nasseh method) is introduced in which familiar elements of visualization of 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional data sets are used to visualize higher dimensional data sets so that it will be easier to explore the data sets in the corresponding dimensions. Nasseh method can be used in many applications from illustrating points in high-dimensional geometry to visualizing estimated Pareto-fronts for many-objective optimization problems.},

abstract = {This paper presents the multiobjective optimization of methyl orange treatment with ozone using Normal Boundary Intersection and response surface models of rotated principal component factor scores for the expected value E[f(x)] and prediction variance Var[f(x)] of dye removal (Y1) and chemical oxygen demand removal (Y2). The innovation and the main contribution of this paper consists of building a 2-dimensional equispaced and convex Pareto Frontier for rotated factor scores representing the original multivariate set, reducing the number of objective functions without inverting the correlation among the original responses. Furthermore, this proposal provides a practical way to generate the narrowest possible prediction confidence intervals for a desired optima using the fuzzy membership function criterion in order to select the best compromise solution between E[f(x)] and Var[f(x)]. To illustrate the proposal's feasibility, a central composite design for the ozonation process of methyl orange solution with three factors (x1 = pH, x2 = air flow and x3 = ozone dosage) was run. The optimization results showed a maximum dye removal of 94.1{\%} ± 4.3 with a respective chemical oxygen demand removal of 88.4{\%} ± 5.3 obtained at x* = [9.5; 7.1 l.min-1; 18.4 g h−1]. However, this point have presented the largest 95{\%} prediction confidence interval. Based on the fuzzy membership of Pareto set it was possible to select the narrowest 95{\%} confidence intervals with maximum removal rates (Y1 = 90.5 ± 2.2 and Y2 = 88.3 ± 2.7), obtained at x* = [7.9, 5.6 l min−1, 18.4 g h−1]. Confirmation runs and comparisons among several optimization methods were done and indicated that the results fell within the respective confidence intervals for predictions, which corroborates the good adequacy of the proposal.},

It is based on an adaptation of the parallel coordinate plot, a tool for graphical representation of points in multidimensional spaces that, theoretically and contrary to the usual Cartesian plots, does not have limits in the dimension of the points being depicted. The joint use of the Pareto-optimal solutions and their visualization allows a deeper knowledge about the problem at hand as well as the wise selection of the conditions of experimental factors for achieving specific goals about the responses. Although the methodology is for a general use, the procedure, its interpretation and usefulness is shown with several analytical cases in chromatography. The first one refers to the experimental conditions to obtain simultaneously the maximum allowable area for both the peak of the malachite green and its metabolite leucomalachite green in fish by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC–MS/MS). The second one is about the simultaneous determination of steroid hormones estrone and 17-$\alpha$-ethinylestradiol by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS). In the last case, the chromatographic separation by GC/MS of the diastereoisomers, $\alpha$- and $\beta$-estradiol is needed taking into account that these hormones have the same mass fragments.},

abstract = {Helical milling is an eco-friendly hole-making process considering energy economy, tool inventory reduction, tool life cycle increase, set-up and non-productive times reduction due to tools changes and better borehole quality. In order to achieve the best results in terms of the sustainable manufacturing aspects energy, quality, and productivity, the present paper proposes to optimize the multi-objective helical milling process of the aluminum alloy Al 7075. With consideration to sustainable objectives, the axial cutting force component, related to energy consumption, the total roundness, related to borehole geometrical quality, and the material removal rate, related to productivity, were taken into account. The process factors axial and tangential feed per tooth and cutting velocity were selected, besides the noise factor tool overhang length, allowing to optimize bias and variance of cutting force and roundness together with the deterministic response material removal rate. In order to achieve a complete exploitation of the Pareto frontier, the new multi-objective optimization method augmented-enhanced normalized normal constraint method was proposed. It was obtained a set of Pareto optimal solutions for the mean square error of the axial cutting force, mean square error of the total roundness, and material removal rate, achieving the trade-off among energy, quality, and productivity. Therefore, different optimization scenarios were obtained, allowing to the experimenter the possibility of choice, guaranteeing a sustainable hole-making process. Furthermore, besides allowing the possibility of choosing different solutions, the TOPSIS decision-making approach was performed so that the best compromise solution was found among the Pareto optimal solutions. The helical milling of the aluminum alloy Al 7075 is presented as a green machining process.},

abstract = {In order to improve equipment efficiency in terms of performance, energy consumption and degradation for example, the industry has increased the use of control systems as the PID (proportional-integral-derivative) to a new baseline. This structure has few parameters to adjust and it is easy to implement practically. However, there are some requirements often included on multivariable systems that cannot be solved concurrently by classical methods. To solve this problem, the current paper approaches the application of Multiobjective Differential Evolution (MODE), Multiobjective Harmony Search (MOHS) and Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) on multivariable PID controllers tuning. Moreover, an improved version of MOPSO (I-MOPSO) is proposed and its performance is compared with the other algorithms. In order to validate it under control systems, the optimization technique is applied on a two degree of freedom robotic manipulator. Finally, a detailed analysis is made on the I-MOPSO achievements.},

abstract = {The integration of energy storage systems in power distribution networks allows to obtain several benefits, such as, the minimization of energy losses, the improvement of voltage profile and the reduction of the energy costs. However, due to the high cost of these energy storage systems, this integration must be carefully applied. Thus, this work proposes the integration of energy storage systems based on a multiobjective optimization. The type of storage systems that is considered are the batteries. These systems require electronic power converters as an interface between the batteries and the grid. Thus, this work uses those converters to supply an ancillary service, more specifically, reactive power compensation. In this way, besides the peak shaving, the optimization approach will also consider the reactive-power compensation, allowing to improve the capital investment return of these systems. The reactive power compensation considers the maximum active power of the converter, to minimize the cost of the system. In consequence, when the energy storage system is at its maximum discharge mode, the reactive power compensation function will be inhibited. Since the multi-objective optimization generates a Pareto-optimal set with a large number of solutions, an approach to support the choice of the solution is also proposed. This approach considers a new post-Pareto analysis, which is based on the sum of the ranking differences. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach, a case study using the 94-bus real test feeder is presented. Three scenarios tests are also presented for the post-pareto optimality analysis, each considering different weights for the objective functions. The results show that even for a specific case where the weights are assigned for each of the objective functions, more than one solution is obtained.},

abstract = {An algorithmic implementation is presented to deal with several responses in mixtures problems, without theoretical limits on the number of responses or on the factors to be blended. Also, constrained and unconstrained domains are handled, as well as domains with both mixtures and discrete variables. Besides, an alternative way of interpreting the results coming from the experimental design for mixtures is presented. It is based on the parallel coordinates plots for visualization in more than the usual three-dimensional Cartesian diagrams or the simplex mixture spaces for at most four experimental factors. Specifically, this is done in cases in which more than one experimental response should be handled, tackling the conflict by estimating trading-off solutions via the computation of the pareto-optimal front, which is fully explored with the parallel coordinates plots. The procedure is shown by two case-studies, taken from the literature. The first one deals with several factors in a constrained experimental domain when trying to optimize a detergent by taking into account two severely conflicting characteristics. The second one is about five chemical components blended with different dosage levels for getting a concrete strong enough, experimental results that are re-evaluated by posing a unique blocked design for analysing the data. The joint use of the pareto-optimal front for mixtures designs and the parallel coordinates plots for its visualization provide the researcher a deeper understanding of the problem under study to make accurate decisions.},

In this paper, a modified version of the BBO is proposed to improve its convergence. The MBBO algorithm is compared with the BBO using benchmarks functions.

widely accepted for controlling industrial systems where one objective
function is the performance criterion. The question is whether the
same success can be achieved for more than one objective function
using the basic PID controller, while preserving its simplicity for
use by an operator. Here the authors explore the use of multiobjective
optimization for the purpose of extending PID controllers to applications
that require the optimization of multiple objectives. An algorithm
is implemented that runs in real-time and provides immediate feedback
to a process operator about the current operating point. It was applied
to the tuning of a PID controller to meet multiple objectives for
the plastication phase of an injection molding process. The algorithm
was implemented on an injection molding machine and allowed to tune
the controller on-line. Simulation and experimental results are presented
and compared},

The Normal Boundary Intersection algorithm is a scalarization scheme for generating a set of evenly spaced Efficient solutions. A drawback of this algorithm is that Pareto-optimality of solutions is not guaranteed. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, it presents alternate formulation of this algorithms, such that (weak) Pareto-optimality of solutions is guaranteed. This improvement makes these algorithm theoretically equivalent to other classical algorithms (like weighted-sum or -constraint methods), without losing its ability to generate a set of evenly spaced Efficient solutions. Second, an algorithm is presented so as to know beforehand about certain sub-problems whose solutions are not Pareto-optimal and thus not wasting computational effort to solve them. The relationship of the new algorithm with weighted-sum and goal programming method is also presented.},

However, during recent decades due to the limitations on the available water in many regions, the optimal water reservoir usage has been highlighted. In this regard, this paper proposes a multi-objective model for short-term hydrothermal scheduling problem in the presence of the pumped-storage technology. It is noted that the framework well models the cascaded configuration of hydro reservoirs. Besides, in order to more accurately model the mentioned problem, a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) optimization framework is presented. In this respect, the valve-loading effects occurred in thermal power generation technologies have been taken into account which turns the existing convex optimization problem into a non-convex one. In order to solve the mentioned problem, the Normal Boundary Intersection (NBI) method has been used while the VIKOR decision maker is employed to choose the most compromise solution amongst the Pareto optimal solutions obtained by NBI method. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed model has been verified through implementing four case studies and comparing the obtained results with those obtained by different methods.},

This study focuses on the Pareto optimal solution visualization method using the self-organizing maps which is one of promising visualization methods. The method has advantages in grasping the overall structure of the solutions and comparing the objective functions simultaneously. However, this method has shortcomings in its solution representation capability. This study proposes a new Pareto optimal solution visualization method using MIGSOM. The MIGSOM is one of the self-organizing algorithms inspired by the neuronal migration. In the MIGSOM algorithm, all input data directly migrate in the projection map space so as to form a suitable map. This direct migration is expected to contribute to the improvements of the solution representation capability. Three improvements are introduced for the application of MIGSOM to the visualization. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed through comparisons to the visualization method using conventional MIGSOM.},

abstract = {There are a good number of different algorithms to solve multi- and many-objective optimization problems and the final outcome of these algorithms is a set of trade-off solutions that are expected to span the entire Pareto-front. Visualization of a Pareto-front is vital for an initial decision-making task, as it provides a number of useful information, such as closeness of one solution to another, trade-off among conflicting objectives, localized shape of the Pareto-front vis-a-vis the entire front, and others. Two and three-dimensional Pareto-fronts are trivial to visualize and allow all the above analysis to be done comprehensively. However, for four or more objectives, visualization for extracting above decision-making information gets challenging and new and innovative methods are long overdue. Not only does a trivial visualization becomes difficult, the number of points needed to represent a higher-dimensional front increase exponentially. The existing high-dimensional visualization techniques, such as parallel coordinate plots, scatter plots, RadVis, etc., do not offer a clear and natural view of the Pareto-front in terms of trade-off and other vital localized information needed for a convenient decision-making task. In this paper, we propose a novel way to map a high-dimensional Pareto-front in two and three dimensions. The proposed method tries to capture some of the basic topological properties of the Pareto points and retain them in the mapped lower dimensional space. Therefore, the proposed method can produce faithful representation of the topological primitives of the high-dimensional data points in terms of the basic shape (and structure) of the Pareto-front, its boundary, and visual classification of the relative trade-offs of the solutions. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we apply our proposed palette visualization method to a few problems.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Optimal Experiment Design (OED) is an indispensable tool in order to reduce the amount of labour and cost intensive experiments in the modelling phase. The unknown parameters are often non-linearly present in the dynamic process models. This means that the Fisher Information Matrix also depends on the current guess for the parameters. In the early stage of the modelling phase these estimates are often highly uncertain. So designing an optimal experiment without taking this uncertainty into account is troublesome. In order to obtain an informative experiment, a robust optimisation approach is necessary. In recent work a formulation using an implicit weighted sum approach is proposed where the objective function is split in a nominal optimal experiment design part and a robust counterpart. This weighted sum has well known drawbacks in a Multi-Objective Optimisation approach. In this work these objectives are studied using advanced methods like the Normal Boundary Intersection and the Normalised Normal Constraint. In this way, the experimenter gets an overview of the different experiments possible. Furthermore, in past work the necessary third order derivatives are approximated using a finite different approach. The results in this work are obtained using exact third order and fourth order derivatives by exploiting the symbolic and automatic derivation methods implemented in the ACADO-toolkit.},

abstract = {The conflict between the transient performance of the link position and tip vibration in a flexible link system has made the control of such system a challenging task. The system is required to obtain a fast transient position response together with minimal tip vibration. This can be viewed like many other real-life control problems as a multi-objectives optimization problem in which an optimal compromise between the design objectives is required. PID controller is noted with historical simplicity in terms of design and implementation when compares to other linear time invariant (LTI) control techniques. However, the shortcoming of PID lies in the tuning of the controller gains for a given problem. To overcome this, a Multiobjective Differential Evolution (MODE)-based PID controller is reported in this study for controlling a flexible link system. The gains of the PID controller are tuned using a developed MATLAB-based MODE to obtain pareto-solutions for both link position and tip vibration. The performance of the selected best PID controller from MODE-based design is benchmarked with the LQR controller provided by the manufacturer (QUANSER) of the laboratory scale flexible link plant. Though, the LQR shows better transient performance in the position responses, the developed MODE-PID gave better tip response performances as indicated in both the simulation and experimental responses obtained.},

Special attention is given to the impacts of suppliers' emission

employs supply function equilibrium (SFE) model to represent the
strategic behavior of each supplier and locational marginal pricing
mechanism for the market clearing. The optimal bidding strategies
are developed mathematically using a bilevel optimization problem
where the upper-level subproblem maximizes individual supplier payoff
and the lower-level subproblem solves the Independent System Operator's
market clearing problem. In order to solve market clearing mechanism
the multiobjective optimal power flow is used with supplier emission
of pollutants, as an extra objective, subject to the supplier physical
constraints. This paper uses normal boundary intersection (NBI) approach
for generating Pareto optimal set and then fuzzy decision making
to select the best compromise solution. The developed algorithm is
applied to an IEEE 30-bus test system. Numerical results demonstrate

abstract = {Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is a powerful technique that can be used to control many industrial processes. Different and often conflicting control objectives, e.g., reference tracking, disturbance rejection and minimum control effort, are typically present. Most often these objectives are translated into a single weighted sum (WS) objective function. This approach is widespread because it is easy to use and understand. However, selecting an appropriate set of weights for the objective function is often non-trivial and is mainly done by trial and error. The current study proposes a systematic procedure for tuning Nonlinear MPC based on multi-objective optimisation methods. Advanced methods allow an efficient solution of the multi-objective problem providing a systematic overview of the controller behaviour. Moreover, through analytic relations it is possible to link a solution obtained with these novel methods to a set of weights for a weighted sum objective function. Applying this set of weights causes the WS to generate the same solution as obtained with the advanced method. Hence, an appropriate controller can be selected based on the alternatives generated by the advanced method, while the corresponding weights for a WS can be derived for implementing the controller in practice. The procedure is successfully tested on two benchmark applications: the Van de Vusse reactor and the Tennessee Eastman plant. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

As it has been widely reported elsewhere, 80 years later PID is still the most common control algorithm used in the processes industry. In this article, fundamentals of PID control are outlined. Starting from the elemental constituent control actions that are at the core of the basic control law, additional considerations, functionalities, and implementation facts are also introduced. Afterward, special attention is placed on the considerations regarding PID-based feedback control loops. Although the central concept of PID control can be gleaned from an examination of how these three terms are blended to form a control signal, the intelligent application of PID control in any given case requires an understanding of the process dynamics at hand as well of the achievable feedback properties.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a new algorithm for the automatic adaptation
of linear single-loop controllers. The algorithm is based on the
idea of unfalsified control, where a set of controllers is defined
and using measured data, the controller from the set is chosen online
which provides the best performance. This scheme is extended here
by an adaptation of the set of controllers after a change of the
operating point of the plant. The original concept of unfalsified
control relies on the computation of the performance of controllers
that are not in the loop using so-called fictitious signals. However,
the proposed cost function leads to erroneous results, in particular,
it is not possible to detect closed-loop instability that may result
from inserting a controller. Therefore a different cost function
and a new method for online evaluation of controllers that are not
in the loop without an explicit plant model are proposed. With this
new cost function, the set of controllers can be adapted as well
which is performed using an evolutionary algorithm. The method is
demonstrated for a well-known example, the nonlinear non-minimum
phase CSTR model with van der Vusse reaction scheme and PID controllers.},

abstract = {With the increasing applications of wind energy {\&} power technologies, the stochastic fluctuation and reverse peak load regulation characteristic of wind power brings great challenges to unit commitment of power systems. It is difficult to meet the demand of the peak load regulation with the wind power integration for the existing robust unit commitment models when only considering the cost. In order to solve this problem, an additional objective function of the ability of peak load regulation is constructed for unit commitment solutions. As a result, a novel multi-objective robust unit commitment model considering both the cost and peak load regulation is proposed. Moreover, probabilistic scenario analysis is applied to constraint the model of the fluctuant wind power, and temporal correlation of wind powers is also considered to further improve the economy in the long run. In order to deal with multi-objective problem for the robust optimization solutions, the above-mentioned problem is decomposed into two stages, i.e., a main problem and a subproblem. The main problem is to determine unit commitment and the subproblem is a "min–max optimization" one to obtain the unit outputs. Finally, the simulation analysis based on IEEE118 node system verified the robustness and the validity of the proposed model.},

abstract = {Classification is a frequently encountered data mining problem. Decision tree techniques have been widely used to build classification models as such models closely resemble human reasoning and are easy to understand. Many real-world classification problems are cost-sensitive, meaning that different types of misclassification errors are not equally costly. Since different decision trees may excel under different cost settings, a set of non-dominated decision trees should be developed and presented to the decision maker for consideration, if the costs of different types of misclassification errors are not precisely determined. This paper proposes a multi-objective genetic programming approach to developing such alternative Pareto optimal decision trees. It also allows the decision maker to specify partial preferences on the conflicting objectives, such as false negative vs. false positive, sensitivity vs. specificity, and recall vs. precision, to further reduce the number of alternative solutions. A diabetes prediction problem and a credit card application approval problem are used to illustrate the application of the proposed approach. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Multi-objective robust PID controller design problem is formulated by minimizing integral squared error (ISE) and balanced robust performance criteria. During the search, 2LB-MOPSO can focus on small regions in the parameter space in the vicinity of the best existing fronts. As the lbests are chosen from the top fronts in a non-domination sorted external archive of reasonably large size, the offspring obtained can be more diverse with good fitness. The performance of various optimal PID controllers is compared in terms of the sum of ISE and balanced robust performance criteria. For the purpose of comparison, 2LB-MOPSO, NSGA-II as well as earlier reported Riccati, IGA and OSA methods are considered. The performance of PID controllers obtained using 2LB-MOPSO is better than that of others. In addition, Hypervolume-based comparisons are carried out to show the superior performance of 2LB-MOPSO over NSGA-II. The results reveal that 2LB-MOPSO yields better robustness and consistency in terms of the sum of ISE and balanced robust performance criteria than various optimal PID controllers.},

abstract = {The goethite process is complicated since its chemical reactions interact with each other, making its control and optimization in industrial production difficult. The goal of the goethite process is to make the outlet ion concentration satisfy the technical requirements with minimal process consumption. To simplify the difficulties of optimization in the goethite process, an optimization method based on a set-point tracking strategy is proposed. The set-point tracking strategy is used to transform the complex state constraints into an additional objective. Therefore, the single optimization control problem for the goethite process is transformed into a bi-objective optimization control problem. Furthermore, PID controllers are adopted to control the addition amounts of zinc oxide and oxygen in the goethite process. The optimal parameters of the PID controllers are obtained via a multi-objective state transition algorithm (MOSTA). The performance of MOSTA is verified by several benchmark test functions with performance matrices. The control performance reveals that the proposed method is an effective way to control the process and can not only reduce the zinc oxide and oxygen addition amounts compared with manual operation and traditional PID control but also reject disturbances. The proposed method can satisfy the industrial requirements with less energy consumption.},
