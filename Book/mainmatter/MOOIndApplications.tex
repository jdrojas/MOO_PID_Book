In this chapter different examples are going to be used as exploration ground for the \gls{moo} framework for \gls{pid} tuning. In Section~\ref{sec:Bechmark} the \gls{ennc} method is applied in a typical high order benchmark plant. Then in Section~\ref{sec:LiTAO3}, the framework is tested with a the temperature control in a deposition process of lithium tantalate (LiTaO$_3$) which has a important dead-time. Finally, the MOOTuning software is used to analyze the temperature control in a Continuous Stirred Tank Heater in Section~\ref{sec:CSTH}.

\section{High order benchmark plant}
\label{sec:Bechmark}
First the \gls{ennc} method is going to be tested in high order benchmark plant \cite{Astroem2000}. The model of the plant is given by a fourth order transfer function:
\begin{equation}
P(s) = \frac{1}{\prod_{n=0}^{n=3}(0.5^n s+1)}.
\label{eq:benchmarkTF}
\end{equation}

The first step is to obtain a low order model that is able to reflect the main dynamics of the plant. In general, the tuning of \gls{pid} controllers starts with a first or second order model \cite{Alfaro2006}. In this particular case, using a step change as the input signal, the low order model that can be found from this experiment is given by:
%
\begin{equation}
F(s)=\frac{e^{-0.297s}}{(0.9477s+1)(0.6346s+1)},
\label{eq:BenchTFfit}
\end{equation}
%
alternatively, if it is supposed that the ``real'' model of the plant is known, an order reduction procedure, for example, the half-rule method \cite{Skogestad2003} may be used. The comparison between the high order model and the reduced order model in the time domain is presented in %
\begin{figure}[tb]

	\caption{Comparison between the high and reduced order models.}
	\label{fig:Ch7CompRespBench}
\end{figure}
%
Figure~\ref{fig:Ch7CompRespBench}. As it can be seen, the model represent accurately the dynamics of the original plant and therefore is considered to be a good approximation of the original model.

The next step is to find the Pareto front for this particular plant. The followed methodology was as presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:PIDMOOP}. For this particular case, only $J_{di}$ and $J_r$ where considered as the cost functions with a \gls{2dof} \gls{pid} controller. In Figure~\ref{fig:paretomodelo}, the obtained Pareto front is presented.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{paretomodelo}%
	\caption{The Pareto front for the benchmark process.}%
	\label{fig:paretomodelo}%
\end{figure}

The curve has a typical form, with a high slope for low values of $J_{di}$ and an almost flat slope for higher values. This shape has a particular physical meaning: to improve the response of the $J_{di}$ cost function, the $J_{r}$ value has to be augmented (worsening the servo response), however the degradation is not as much as the improvement in the $J_{di}$ function. This is a clear example of one of the many advantages of using a multi-objective framework for controller tuning and the main reason why is the chosen framework in this book, it gives the decision taker more tools to select the more appropriate tuning for the controllers.

In order to compare the response of the optimal controllers, the tuning for the anchor points are presented along the resposes of the ART$_2$ method \cite{Vilanova2011} and the uSORT$_2$ method\cite{Alfaro2012a}, in order to compare the performance of the closed loop response. It is important to clarify that these two tuning are just the extreme points of the Pareto front, thanks to the ENNC method and that there is a practically and infinite amount of possible parameter tuning to select. The obtained parameters are listed in %

\end{table}
%
Table~\ref{tab:parametroscontrolador} for reference. It is important to note that in all cases, the Maximum Sensibility was set to be around $M_s = 2.0$ to ensure a minimum level of robustness.

In Figure~\ref{fig:Ch7cambioreferencia}, the closed-loop responses of all the four controllers are presented for the case of a step change in the setpoint. it was found that precisely the controller in the anchor point of the Pareto front that give the minimum value of $J_r$ is in fact the one that give the best result of all the controllers. However, it has to be noticed that both ART$_2$ and uSORT methods are intended for regulator response mainly, and theredore, it was not expected to have a low $J_r$. The obtained values are given in Table~\ref{tab:IAEref} where both the \gls{iae} and \gls{ms} are presented. 

On the other hand, the optimal controllers in the regulator mode are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:cambiodi}. Again, as expected, the controller in the anchor point that has the lowest value of $J_{di}$, is the one with the fastest response. Also, it is clear that the other anchor point (the one with the lowest value of $J_r$) has the worst response for disturbance rejection as it was expected. In table \ref{tab:IAEdi}, the corresponding values of IAE for the curves in Figure~\ref{fig:cambiodi} are presented.

The optimal controller for disturbance rejection is presented in figure \ref{fig:cambiodi}. Again, the tuning given by the ENNC method is the fastest response to reach the desired value. As it can be seen, the ART$_2$ and the uSORT$_{2}$ methods fall between these two optimal responses. However, it does not necessarily means that these methods are optimal because they could be dominated by other controllers that are exactly in the front. Only the tuning found with the ENNC method can be considered to be Pareto optimal using the \gls{iae} as the metric. In Table~\ref{tab:IAEdi}, the IAE values of the responses presented in Figure~\ref{fig:cambiodi} are stated, and again the controller that achieves the lower error value is the one that correspond to the anchor point.

\section{LiTaO$_3$ Thin Film Deposition Process}
\label{sec:LiTAO3}
Temperature control is a very important factor in the deposition process of lithium tantalate (LiTaO$_3$) by means of metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) \cite{Zhang2004}.


The dynamics of the reactor chamber are characterized by a large lag and time-delay. It is important for the quality of the final product, that the controller follow a predefined temperature profile accurately (servo control) while been able to reject other disturbances (regulatory control).

The model of the MOCVD chamber can be given by:
\begin{equation}
G(s) = \frac{K e^{-L s}}{T s+1},
\label{eq:GsLita}
\end{equation}
%
where the gain $K = 3.2$, the time constant $T = 200$~s and the time-delay $L = 150$~s.

For this case, a two function MOOP is considered with $J_{di}$ and $J_{r}$ as cost functions and a robustness restriction of $M_S = 2.0$. When solving the optimization using the ENNC method, the obtained Pareto front is as given in %
\begin{figure}

\section{Continuous stirred tank heater}
\label{sec:CSTH}
%
\subsection{Description of the process}
\label{sec:Description}
%
The control of a \gls{csth} is a common task in industrial processes. In this section, the control of the temperature of the \gls{csth} will be solved as a \gls{moop} using a \gls{2dof} \gls{pid} controller. The diagram of the process is presented in %
\begin{figure}[b]
	\centering
	\includegraphics{Ch7CSTR}
	\caption{Simplified diagram of a continuous stirred-tank heater to be controlled.}
	\label{fig:Ch7CSTR}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:Ch7CSTR}. A heat exchanger is installed inside the tank to heat the fluid. The flow rate inside the heat exchanger is controlled with a valve with input variable $U_T$ and the liquid inside the heat exchanger enters with temperature $T_{ci}$ and leaves with temperature $T_{co}$, the average temperature inide the heat exchanger is $T_{ca}$. The volume inside the tank is variable, the input flow rate is $Q_i$ with temperature $T_i$. The output flow rate is $Q$ with temperature $T$. The output flow rate is controlled with a valve with input variable $U_L$. The tank is covered with a jacket that prevents any heat loss to the atmosphere.

According to \cite{Alfaro2016}, a possible model for this process is given by the following set of algebraic-differential equations:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Tank mass balance:
			\begin{equation*}
				A \frac{d H(t)}{dt} = Q_i(t) - Q(t),
			\end{equation*}
			where $A$ is the transversal area of the tank and $H(t)$ is the liquid level.
	\item Tank energy balance:
			\begin{equation*}
				\rho C_p A H(t) \frac{T(t)}{dt} = \rho C_p Q_i(t)\left( T_i(t) - T(t)\right) + W(t),
			\end{equation*}
			where $C_p$ is the heat capacity of the fluid and $W(t)$ is the rate of heat transfer from the heat exchanger to the tank. $W(t)$ can be modeled as:
	\item Heat exchanger energy balance:
			\begin{equation*}
				\rho_c C_{pc} V_c \frac{T_{ca}(t)}{dt} = \rho_c C_{pc} Q_c(t)\left( T_{ci}(t)-T_{co}(t)\right) - W(t),
			\end{equation*}
			where $\rho_c$ is the density of the fluid inside the heat exchanger, $C_{pc}$ is the heat capacity of the fluid inside the heat exchanger and $V_c$ is the volume of the heat exchanger.
	\item Heat transfer between the heat exchanger and the fluid in the tank:
			\begin{equation*}
				W(t) = U A_c \left( T_{ca}(t) - T(t)\right), 
			\end{equation*}
			where $U$ is overall heat-transfer coefficient, $A_c$ is the area of the heat exchanger, $T_{ca}(t)$ is the average temperature inside the heat exchanger which is related to $T_{co}(t)$ and $T_{ci}(t)$ as:
			\begin{equation*}
				T_{ca}(t) = \frac{T_{ci}(t) + T_{co}(t)}{2}
			\end{equation*}
\end{itemize}

Also, in \cite{Alfaro2016}, the transmitters and the valves are modeled as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Level transmitter: it is supposed that the level transmitter is a capacitive type electronic transmitter that has a first order dynamics:
		\begin{equation*}
			T_L \frac{d Y_L(t)}{dt} + Y_L(t) = K_L H(t),
		\end{equation*}
		%
		where $T_L$ is its time constant, $Y_L$ is the level signal and $K_L$ is the transmitter gain.
	%
	\item Temperature transmitter: It is supposed that a Pt$_{100}$ RTD electronic sensor is installed in a thermowell at the tank outlet pipe. It is supposed that it has a second order dynamic:
	%
		\begin{equation*}
			T_{T}^2 \frac{d^2 Y_T(t)}{dt^2} + 2T_T \frac{d Y_T(t)}{dt} + Y_T(t) = K_T T(t),
		\end{equation*}
		%
		where $T_T$ is its time constant and $K_T$ is its gain.
	%
	\item Level control valve: it is supposed that a ball valve with an electroneumatic actuator is used. The valve	inherent flow characteristics is nearly quadratic and the relationship between the flow $Q(t)$ and the input variable $U_L$ is given by:
		\begin{align*}
			T_{vL} \frac{d X_L(t)}{dt} + X_L(t) = K_{xL} U_L(t),\\
			Q(t) = K_{vL} X_L^2(t)\sqrt{\rho g H(t)},
		\end{align*}
		where $T_{vL}$ is the level control valve time constant, $K_{xL}$ level control valve stem constant $K_{vL}$ level control valve constant and $X_L(t)$ is the level control valve stem normalized travel.
	%
	\item Temperature control valve it is also supposed to be a ball valve with an electroneumatic actuator, however, it is supposed that the valve has an equal-percentage inherent flow characteristics given by:
		\begin{align*}
			T_{vT} \frac{d X_T(t)}{dt} + X_T(t) = K_{xT} U_T(t),\\
			Q_c(t) = K_{vT}R_{vT}^{\left( X_T(t) -1 \right) } \sqrt{P_{cp} - \left(R_c Q^2_c(t)+P_{cr} \right) },
		\end{align*}
		where $T_{vT}$ is the temperature control valve time constant, $K_{xT}$ the temperature control valve stem constant, $K_{vT}$ is the temperature control valve constant $P_{cp}$ is the heating fluid pump discharge pressure, $P_{cr}$ is heating fluid system return pressure and $X_T(t)$ is the temperature control valve stem normalized travel.
\end{itemize}

Taking this model in consideration, it can be said that, from the point of view of the controller, the controlled variables are give by the signals $Y_L(t)$ (which represents the level) and $Y_T(t)$ (which represents the temperature of the fluid of the tank). The manipulated variables are given by $U_L(t)$ (which directly affects $Q$) and $U_T(t)$ (that directly affects $Q_{c}$). $Q_i(t)$, $T_i$ and $T_{ci}$ are considered as disturbances. The state variables of the system are given by $H(t)$, $T_T(t)$, $T_{co}$, $Y_L(t)$, $Y_T$, $X_L(t)$ and $X_T(t)$, therefore, this model comprises a seventh order non-linear system for a two-input two-output industrial process. The parameters of the model can be found in

Figure~\ref{fig:Ch7HeatExhangerEq} the Simulink implementation of the heat exchanger energy balance is presented. The result of this submodel is the computation of the state variable $T_{ca}$, which represents the average temperature of the heating fluid. As it can be seen, the parameters of the model are not hard-coded in the Simulink blocks, instead a parameter initialization script is call before the simulation starts. If the user desires to change any value of the parameters, it can be done globally in the script and then automatically called during the simulation.

\subsection{Simplified linear model}
\label{sec:SimpLinMod}
In order to find a PID controller using the MOOTuning app, it is necessary to find a linear model of the plant in the operation point. An identification procedure was performed with a change of 10\% in the value of $U_T$ to find the transfer function between $Y_T$ and $U_T$. The response to this change is depicted in %
\begin{figure}[tb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{Ch7CSTHResp}
	\caption{Response of the process to a change of 10\% in the $U_T(t)$ input.}
	\label{fig:Ch7CSTHResp}
\end{figure}
%
Figure~\ref{fig:Ch7CSTHResp}. As it can be seen, the response is overdamped and takes approximately \SI{500}{\second} to reach a new steady state. A change in 10\% on the input signal produces a variation of approximately $3.5\%$ in the output signal. It has to be noticed that the presented signals are normalized between 0 and 100\% representing the full spam of the transmitter and actuators.

In order to find the model, the process was supposed to have two poles, no zeros and a pure time-delay (also known as dead-time). Of course, if a linearization procedure were performed using the nonlinear model, a seventh order model would be obtained. However, for PID tuning, a first or second order model is usually expected to tune the controller.

Considering the experiment performed with the data as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:Ch7CSTHResp}, the resulting simplified model is given by:
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{Y_T(s)}{U_T(s)} = \frac{0.3658 e^{-24.736 s}}{(52.861 s+1)(52.805 s +1)}.
\label{eq:TFCSTH}
\end{equation}

From this transfer function, it can be deduced that the gain is equal to $K = 0.3658$, the main time constant is given by $T = 52.861$, the ratio between the two time constant is given by $a = 0.9989$ and the dead-time is given by $L = 24.736$, therefore the normalized dead-time is given by $\tau = 0.4679$.

To test the validity of this simplified model, the response of the transfer function is compared against the response of the non-linear model. It was found that the transfer function response is very similar to the response of the non-linear model, as can be seen in %
%
\begin{figure}[tb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Ch7CSTHComp}
	\caption{Comparison between the linear and no linear models for the CSTH.}
	\label{fig:Ch7CSTHComp}
\end{figure}
%
Figure~\ref{fig:Ch7CSTHComp}. It is clear that the non-linear model is a good representation of the dynamical response of the process. This is the first step in order to find a suitable PID controller to control the plant. In \cite{Alfaro2016} the level of the tank is also controlled, however the dynamic of the level is simpler (its model can be approximated with a first order model without delay) and in this particular example, only the temperature is going to be controlled, while the level is considered to be constant.
%
\subsection{PID control of the CSTH}
\label{sec:PIDCSTH}
In this section, the process will be controlled using a \gls{pid} controller with different tuning methods and compared with the \gls{moo} framework used in the book.

Two different tuning rules were considered: the method by Rovira~\cite{Rovira1969a} and the method by Murril~\cite{Murril1967}. For the case of the Rovira and Murril method, the model in \eqref{eq:TFCSTH} was reduced to a first order model using the Half-Rule in \cite{Skogestad2003}:
\begin{equation}
\frac{Y_T(s)}{U_T(s)} = \frac{0.3658 e^{-24.7360 s}}{79.2635 s +1}.
\label{eq:TFCSTHFirstOrder}
\end{equation}

The equations were implemented as presented in \cite{odwyer2006}:
\begin{itemize}
%	\item SIMC method: Supposing a \gls{soptd} model:
%			\begin{equation*}
%				P(s) = \frac{K e^{-Ls}}{(Ts+1)(aTs+1)}
%			\end{equation*}
%			The corresponding PID tuning for a closed-loop lag time of $T_c = L$ and the case where $T \leq 8 L$, the PID tuning is given by:
%			\begin{align*}
%				K_p &= \frac{0.5}{K}\frac{(1+a)T}{L}\\
%				T_i &= (1 + a) T\\
%				T_d	&= \frac{a}{1+a}T
%			\end{align*}
%	%
	\item Supposing a \gls{foptd} model given by:
			\begin{equation*}
				P(s) = \frac{K e^{-L s}}{Ts+1}
			\end{equation*}
			The Murrill tuning is given by:
				\begin{align*}
					K_p &= \frac{1.435}{K}\left( \frac{T}{L} \right)^{0.921}\\
					T_i &= \frac{T}{0.878}\left( \frac{L}{T}\right)^{0.749}\\\\
					T_d &= 0.482 T \left( \frac{L}{T} \right)^{1.137}
				\end{align*}
	\item Again, supposing a \gls{foptd} as above, the Rovira tuning is given by:
			\begin{align*}
				K_p &= \frac{1.086}{K} \left( \frac{T}{L}\right) ^{0.869} \\
				T_i &= \frac{T}{0.740 - 0.13\frac{L}{T}} \\
				T_d &= 0.384 T \left( \frac{L}{T}\right)^{0.914} 
			\end{align*}
\end{itemize}

Table~\ref{tab:CompPIDCSTH}, along with its associated values of $J_{di}$ and $J_r$. The Murril and Rovira methods presented in the table were selected because they are intended to minimize the \gls{iae}. The SIMC method was selected because it presents a good compromise between performance, robustness and easiness of the tuning rule. In all cases, the PID tuning is for a one degree of freedom controller (that is  the reason why $\beta$ is equal to one).

The PID that can be found using the data and the framework presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:PIDMOOP} is a \gls{soptd}, which may do the comparison somehow unfair. However, below another comparison is made using the same controller topology, the idea now is to compare methods that tries to minimize the \gls{iae}. Using the MOOTuning Tool that accompanies this book, the Pareto front that was found is given as in %

Figure~\ref{fig:Ch7CompPareto}. As it was expected, all the controllers found using the \gls{moo} tool present lower values for $J_{di}$ and $J_r$. If all controllers had the same topology, most certainly both controller would be close to the anchor points. However, what it is important here is the fact that, using the tool, the user has the ability to chose between practically an infinity of possible controllers. From the Pareto front, three different tuning were selected in order to compare the responses using the non-linear plant. The values of the parameters are presented also in Table~\ref{tab:CompPIDCSTH} and depicted as circles in the Pareto front in Figure~\ref{fig:Ch7CompPareto}.

In Figures~\ref{fig:Ch7CompParetoReg} and \ref{fig:Ch7CompParetoServo} the responses to a step change in the setpoint and in the disturbance are presented. The corresponding values of \gls{iae} are also presented in the graph. In all cases, the robustness was not considered as a constraint. but it is possible to include it within the MOOTuning software. From Figure~\ref{fig:Ch7CompPareto} given the steep slope of the curve for lower values of $J_{di}$ that a small change in $J_{di}$ may improve substantially the performance for $J_r$. Therefore, one may be more prone to select a controller that may have a little degradation in $J_{di}$ and for this reason, controller MOO01 may not be a good selection as a final solution unless having the minimum value possible of $J_{di}$ is the final goal.

The controller MOO02 may be seen as an intermediate solution between MOO1 and MOO03 in case both $J_{di}$ and $J_r$ are equally important for the decision maker. The power of the multiobjective framework is evident, and giving that the computational power is done offline, it becomes a good tool for the tuning of PIDs in an industrial setting.
